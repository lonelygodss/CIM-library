# Codex handoff

## Goal

Finish this as a static Astro paper library. Do not add PDF hosting yet.

Root-level project instructions live in `AGENTS.md`. Use this handoff as a short status note; use `AGENTS.md` for ongoing agent behavior.

Current development plan lives in `docs/future-development-plan.md`. A ready-to-use restart prompt lives in `docs/next-session-prompt.md`.

## Design decisions already made

- Paper metadata source: Markdown frontmatter in `src/content/papers/*.md`.
- Taxonomy vocabulary source: `src/data/taxonomy.json`.
- Atlas route: `/library/`.
- Paper route: `/papers/[slug]/`.
- Visualization: prioritize a strong `/library/` taxonomy graph before paper detail-page polish. Use the legacy standalone HTML as the benchmark for node hover summaries, click selection, graph sizing, and selected-paper right-panel visualization. Replace the legacy radar with a derived axis coverage cloud.
- No coverage score, ranking score, or trajectory-IR relevance metadata in the active schema.
- Keep the site static and suitable for personal hosting.

## Current state

All 62 paper notes in `src/content/papers/` have been migrated into schema-valid Astro content entries. The previous raw-note migration blocker is resolved.

Latest verification:

- `npm run validate` passes: `Validated 62 paper metadata file(s).`
- `npm run check` passes: `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints`.
- `npm run build` passes and builds 64 pages into `dist/`.

The final migration batch converted:

- `openc2.md`
- `opencimtc.md`
- `ouroboros.md`
- `papi.md`
- `pim-eda.md`
- `pim-hls.md`
- `pim-opt.md`
- `pim-tc.md`
- `pimacc.md`
- `pimcomp.md`
- `pimsim-nn.md`
- `pimsyn-nn.md`
- `pimeva.md`
- `pimsynth.md`
- `puma.md`
- `polyhedral-based-compilation-framework-for-in-memoryneural-network-accelerators.md`
- `prim.md`
- `rescim.md`
- `reconfigurable-dataflow-cim-accelerator-for-multi-scale-vision-transformer.md`
- `sega-dcim.md`
- `sherlock.md`
- `simplepim.md`
- `sparsep.md`
- `syndcim.md`
- `unindp.md`

Several artifact URLs and conservative metadata values were manually normalized when the note already contained checked evidence. Examples include OpenCIMTC, PIM-EDA, PIM-Opt, PIMACC, PIMCOMP, PIMSIM-NN, PIMSYN-NN, PrIM, and PUMA.

On macOS-style case-insensitive filesystems, Git may show case-only filename normalizations as modifications under the original tracked names until staging. The on-disk lowercase kebab-case filenames are authoritative.

## What to finish next

1. Keep content QA green with `npm run qa`, `npm run validate`, `npm run check`, and `npm run build`.
2. Improve `/library/` before individual paper pages.
3. Use `docs/future-development-plan.md` and `src/content/legacy/cim_compiler_ir_taxonomy_visualization.html` as the guide.
4. Restore or adapt the core legacy graph behaviors: hover summary box, click-to-select node behavior, right-panel selected-paper visualization, and responsive graph sizing.
5. Keep taxonomy explanation simple and readable. Do not copy the legacy explanatory visualization set unless the graph interaction is already solid.
6. Do not reintroduce coverage scores, ranking scores, or `trajectory_IR_relevance` as active metadata. The axis coverage cloud is a derived visual summary, not a score.
7. Improve individual paper page layout only after the atlas is substantially useful.

Use `docs/corpus-note-harness.md` when generating full public notes. Use `docs/legacy-source-map.md` when recovering original overview text or compact-source material from draft artifacts.

## Frontmatter contract

Required fields:

```yaml
slug: lowercase-kebab-case
title: Paper title
summary: public one-paragraph summary
axis_A:
  primary: A1|A2|A3|A4|A5|A6
  secondary: []
axis_B: [B1]
```

Keep arrays inline where possible. The Astro schema is the strict source of truth; `scripts/validate-library.mjs` is a fast preflight check.

Obsolete generated fields such as `coverage` and `trajectory_IR_relevance` should stay out of migrated entries.

## Future imports

For any future raw generated note:

1. Run `node scripts/promote-raw-note.mjs --dry-run <files...>` first.
2. Promote the note with `scripts/promote-raw-note.mjs` only after inspecting planned filenames and warnings.
3. Restore a schema-valid year, URL, or reproducibility label only when official source material or checked note evidence supports it.
4. Run `npm run validate`, then `npm run check`, then `npm run build`.
