## Corpus classification snapshot

CIMFlow is classified primarily as **A5 — narrow end-to-end co-design**, with strong **A3/A4/A2** components. Its middle-layer styles include graph-level task planning, hardware-resource configuration, instruction/meta-op boundaries, and limited runtime-state abstraction through synchronization operations.

## Public summary

CIMFlow is a public SRAM-based digital CIM infrastructure stack for DNN inference that connects an ONNX frontend, hardware configuration, a two-level compiler, a documented 32-bit CIM ISA, and a SystemC cycle-level simulator. For CIM compiler/IR research, it is useful as a coherent vertical stack whose semantics are distributed across CG task JSON, hardware/config JSON, per-core ISA JSON, register conventions, synchronization instructions, and simulator input/output contracts.

## Integration helper

The most direct integration path is to use CIMFlow as a **backend/interface comparison**: keep its CG JSON and ISA JSON as examples of serialized compiler boundaries, then compare those boundaries against future value-trajectory or first-class-flow IR proposals.
