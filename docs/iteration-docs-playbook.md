# Iteration Docs Playbook

Use this when opening, closing, or changing project focus. The goal is to keep default session context small while preserving enough history to recover decisions.

## Context Tiers

### Tier 1: Always Read

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/active-context.md`

These files must stay concise and stable. They should tell a future agent what the project is, what is currently active, and which guardrails are non-negotiable.

### Tier 2: Read When Needed

Task-specific docs live outside the default context:

- Current focus work: the active file named in `docs/active-context.md`.
- Focus switching or resuming a paused focus: `docs/focus/README.md`, then the target file under `docs/focus/`.
- Paper-note work: `docs/corpus-note-harness.md`, `docs/metadata-template.md`, `docs/legacy-source-map.md`.
- Cluster work: `docs/focus/cluster-analysis-working-groups.md`, `docs/future-development-plan.md`, `src/data/clusters.json`, relevant paper notes, and archived cluster seed if needed.
- Website work: `docs/website-integration/README.md` and the specific contract/ADR files it points to.
- Docs work: this playbook and `docs/archive/README.md`.

### Tier 3: Archives

Archives preserve history and rationale. They are not restart context.

Read archives only when:

- reactivating an old focus;
- checking why a route, schema, or page shape exists;
- recovering previously deferred plans;
- comparing current choices against an earlier decision.

## Opening an Iteration

1. Update `docs/active-context.md` with the active focus, current route/data files, and latest known good checks.
2. Put detailed goals and rationale in `docs/future-development-plan.md` or a focused task doc.
3. Keep `docs/next-session-prompt.md` short. It should point to `AGENTS.md`, `docs/active-context.md`, and task-specific docs only by need.
4. Do not paste long task plans into `AGENTS.md`.

## Switching Focus

Use `docs/focus/` when a project focus is paused but should be recoverable without reading archives.

1. Save the outgoing focus state in `docs/focus/<topic>.md`, including status, source files, route/data state, resume guidance, guardrails, and latest verification.
2. Add or update the incoming focus file in `docs/focus/`.
3. Update `docs/focus/README.md` so the active and paused focus files are discoverable.
4. Update `docs/active-context.md` to name the incoming focus and link the paused focus file.
5. Update `docs/next-session-prompt.md` so a future `proceed` resumes the incoming focus.
6. When the incoming focus is marked done, restore or choose the next active focus by reading the relevant focus file and repeating this protocol.

Move a focus file to `docs/archive/` only when it is completed, superseded, or no longer expected to resume.

## During an Iteration

- Update active implementation details near the source of truth.
- Prefer data files and route files for implemented behavior over prose-only claims.
- Keep docs factual: what exists, what is uncertain, what to check next.
- Mark comparison sets explicitly when evidence does not support a lineage claim.
- Do not copy the same state summary into several docs; update `docs/active-context.md` once and link outward.
- Let a session complete one coherent batch when the next step is clear. Batches may include several related source checks, data edits, docs updates, and verification steps, as long as they stay within the same project focus and evidence standard.

## Closing an Iteration

1. Move detailed completed rationale to `docs/archive/`.
2. Update `docs/archive/README.md`.
3. Trim `docs/active-context.md` to only the state that should be default context.
4. Update `docs/next-session-prompt.md` to the new active focus.
5. Leave `AGENTS.md` unchanged unless a stable rule, command, or architecture invariant changed.

## Archive Naming

Use:

```text
docs/archive/YYYY-MM-short-topic-kind.md
```

Kinds:

- `seed` — archived idea or roadmap that may be reactivated.
- `iteration` — completed implementation phase.
- `decision` — focused rationale for a route, schema, or contract choice.
- `postmortem` — lessons from a failed or reverted direction.

Each archive should start with:

```md
# Archived <Kind>: <Topic>

Status: <archived seed | completed | superseded | retained reference>

Default-context policy: Do not read by default. Read when <specific trigger>.
```

## Default Context Budget

Keep these approximate limits:

- `AGENTS.md`: stable rules only, usually under 120 lines.
- `docs/active-context.md`: current state only, usually under 100 lines.
- `docs/next-session-prompt.md`: restart prompt only, usually under 60 lines.

If a doc starts accumulating history, move that history to an archive or a focused task doc.

## Verification

After documentation-only edits, run at least:

```bash
npm run validate
```

After docs that affect website contract, routes, generated manifest, or rendered UI guidance, run:

```bash
npm run qa
npm run validate
npm run export:atlas
npm run contract:website
npm run check
npm run build
```
