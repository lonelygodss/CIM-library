# Future Development Plan

## Current State

This is a static Astro paper library for CIM compiler/IR-stack research.

- `src/content/papers/` contains 62 schema-valid Markdown paper entries.
- The raw-note migration milestone is complete; no raw long-form notes remain.
- The active metadata contract is descriptive. It does not include coverage scores, ranking scores, or `trajectory_IR_relevance`.
- `/` is the personal homepage; `/library/` is the stable full atlas route.
- `/about/`, `/projects/`, and `/projects/cim-library/` form the current website shell around the atlas.
- `/papers/[slug]/` renders individual long-form corpus notes.
- Axis C first-class objects and Axis D rewrite objects are normalized at render time from `src/data/taxonomy.json` vocabulary, without adding new required frontmatter fields.
- The atlas supports both Axis A x Axis B and normalized Axis C x Axis D layouts.
- The personal website dev kit is installed as the active next development context. The CIM Library should become a first-class static project module inside a personal website shell.
- The active visual direction is a quiet academic personal site inspired by older physics faculty pages: serif type, plain rules, sparse blue/green links, and one main DAG-like homepage index. Project modules may use distinct UI surfaces, including the CIM atlas card/control style, as long as they remain integrated through the shell routes.
- Keep the site static and suitable for personal hosting. Do not add PDF hosting, backend services, or a database unless the project direction changes.

Keep these checks green while changing UI or content:

```bash
npm run qa
npm run validate
npm run check
npm run build
```

Latest known good baseline:

- `npm run validate`: `Validated 62 paper metadata file(s).`
- `npm run qa`: 62 files, 62 structured, 0 raw files; source/provenance coverage is now reported as informational audit output.
- `npm run check`: `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints`.
- `npm run build`: 64 static pages.

## Completed Focus -- Atlas Core

The main `/library/` atlas focus is now substantially done.

Implemented:

- large Axis A x Axis B graph as the first main section on `/library/`;
- deterministic node spreading for dense cells;
- hover/focus summaries and click-to-select behavior;
- filtered paper picker and reset controls;
- selected-paper right panel focused on Axis C first-class objects and Axis D rewrite objects;
- selected-paper Axis A x Axis B coverage shown directly on the atlas as a non-scoring background cloud;
- short taxonomy explanation after the graph;
- responsive controls and mobile horizontal graph scroll;
- paper detail page CSS improvements for long notes, tables, code blocks, and mobile wrapping.

## Completed Focus -- Detail Pages and Atlas Scoping, First Pass

Implemented:

- render-time Axis C/D normalization using `src/data/taxonomy.json` object and rewrite vocabularies;
- separate Axis C and Axis D atlas filters;
- atlas layout switch between Axis A x Axis B and normalized Axis C x Axis D;
- URL state for `layout=cd`, `c=`, `d=`, exact scoped cells through `cx=` / `cy=`, plus existing `tech=` and `workload=`;
- detail-page normalized Axis C/D chips and context chips that link back into scoped atlas views;
- atlas selected-paper card split from hover preview, so click pins a paper while hover previews the active object/rewrite cloud;
- responsive atlas profiles with larger nodes and tighter labels for A/B and C/D views;
- expandable object/rewrite/context clouds for long metadata lists;
- dense-cell summary under the atlas with one-click exact scoping for the plotted cell.

Do not rebuild the atlas from scratch. Future atlas work should be incremental and should use current frontmatter plus `src/data/taxonomy.json` as source of truth.

## Completed Focus -- Detail-Page Provenance, First Pass

Implemented:

- detail-page provenance strip summarizing paper-source presence, artifact-link presence, artifact status, and last-checked date;
- hero source actions generated from existing `links.paper`, `links.artifact`, `links.docs`, `links.code`, and `artifact.url` metadata;
- richer source cards with source role labels, short descriptions, and hostnames;
- explanatory source note clarifying that artifact status and checked date come from the recorded corpus pass rather than live monitoring;
- responsive source/provenance layout with single-column mobile behavior and no horizontal overflow in checked viewports.

This pass did not add new schema fields. It surfaces the current descriptive frontmatter more clearly.

## Completed Focus -- Provenance QA, First Pass

Implemented:

- `npm run qa` now reports source/provenance coverage for `links.paper`, `links.artifact`, `artifact.url`, `links.docs`, and `links.code`;
- missing paper-source links are listed as informational audit items;
- missing artifact `last_checked` dates are checked separately from artifact URL coverage;
- artifact URLs recorded only under `artifact.url` are surfaced so the frontmatter can be normalized intentionally;
- disagreements between `links.artifact` and `artifact.url` are reported;
- entries with no recorded source links are listed.

Current mechanical audit reading:

- `links.paper` is now populated for 61/62 entries after high-confidence backfill from checked body citations and source records.
- `links.artifact` is now populated for 38/62 entries and aligned with the existing `artifact.url` coverage.
- `pim-eda.md` is the only remaining entry without `links.paper`; it is a suite/toolchain entry composed from several related papers, so leave it blank unless a canonical suite paper is identified.
- no entries currently lack all frontmatter source links.
- `artifact.last_checked` is complete across the current corpus.
- artifact status and artifact URL fields currently have no contradiction according to the QA script.
- artifact URL-only entries and `links.artifact` / `artifact.url` disagreements are currently zero.

## Completed Focus -- Audit Pass From Next-Session Steps 1-5

This pass closed the previous restart prompt's first five tasks.

- Axis C/D normalization was spot-checked across macro-generator, mapper/compiler, simulator, runtime, benchmark, suite, and mapper-family entries.
- Axis C instruction-stream matching was tightened so `bit_stream` / `bit stream` terms stay under numeric-format categories instead of falsely matching instruction streams.
- `pim-eda.md` provenance was rechecked against the umbrella PIM-Toolchain repository, ICT CAS project page, and Xiaoming Chen profile. No standalone canonical suite paper was identified, so `links.paper` remains intentionally blank.
- `links.artifact` and `artifact.url` remain aligned. QA reports zero artifact URL-only entries and zero artifact link/url disagreements.
- Rendered-note Markdown was audited for formulas, tables, and code blocks. A dependency-free rehype formatter now styles TeX-style inline/display formulas without changing corpus Markdown.
- Raw technology/workload terms were audited. They remain descriptive but noisy, so controlled vocabularies should wait until there is a concrete browsing problem to solve.

## Completed Focus -- Cleanup and Handoff

This iteration also cleaned up context for future work:

- removed stale handoff-file references from the restart path and README;
- removed redundant math-formatting scaffolding, leaving a single rehype-based formatter;
- condensed `docs/next-session-prompt.md` into a current-state restart prompt instead of a long historical changelog;
- updated `AGENTS.md` so it reflects the completed raw-note migration and current atlas architecture.

## Archived Focus -- Cluster Analysis and Working Groups

The previous cluster-analysis and academic-working-group roadmap is archived at `docs/archive/cluster-analysis-working-groups.md`.

It is intentionally inactive for the current website-integration iteration. Reinitialize it later only if the project direction returns to cluster visualization after the personal website shell stabilizes.

## Next Focus -- Personal Website Shell Stabilization

The next product milestone is to stabilize the static website shell around the CIM atlas using the installed dev kit in `docs/website-integration/`.

Target architecture:

```text
personal website shell
├── /                         personal homepage
├── /projects/                project index from src/data/project-registry.json
├── /projects/cim-library/    narrative landing page for this atlas
├── /library/                 full CIM atlas app
└── /papers/[slug]/           paper notes
```

Installed integration surface:

- `docs/website-integration/`: route map, plan, content/UI harness, ADR, schemas, templates, and agent addendum.
- `src/data/project-registry.json`: website project registry, initialized with the CIM Library entry.
- `scripts/export-atlas-manifest.mjs`: static manifest exporter for `public/cim-library.manifest.json`.
- `scripts/check-website-contract.mjs`: route/file/registry/manifest contract checker.
- `scripts/website-devkit-smoke.mjs`: repeatable website-integration smoke harness.
- `npm run export:atlas`, `npm run contract:website`, and `npm run smoke:website`.

Remaining priority work:

1. Run and keep green the website loop: `npm run qa`, `npm run validate`, `npm run export:atlas`, `npm run contract:website`, `npm run check`, and `npm run build`.
2. Keep polishing `/`, `/about/`, `/projects/`, and `/projects/cim-library/` as the personal website shell. The homepage should introduce the person/research focus and route visitors through a single DAG-like index; it should not embed the whole atlas UI.
3. Keep `/projects/` sourced from `src/data/project-registry.json`.
4. Keep `/projects/cim-library/` as the narrative project landing page that explains the atlas, links to `/library/`, and highlights representative paper notes.
5. Keep `/library/` and `/papers/[slug]/` stable.
6. Use `public/cim-library.manifest.json` for project stats and summaries rather than copying counts by hand.

The homepage and profile shell should stay visually quiet. The atlas and future project routes can use different UI systems when the project itself needs cards, controls, visualizations, or dense interaction.

The atlas should remain descriptive. Do not introduce coverage, quality, ranking, or relevance scores.

Keep changes schema-compatible unless there is a clear reason to update `src/content.config.ts`.

## Content QA

Content QA is mostly green, but keep these checks in mind during edits:

- preserve the 62-entry corpus unless intentionally adding/removing papers;
- keep slugs unique and filename-aligned;
- keep Axis A/B values within `src/data/taxonomy.json`;
- keep generated-note artifacts out of rendered notes;
- keep artifact URLs, years, venues, and reproducibility labels evidence-based;
- do not invent publication facts or artifact behavior.

Use `scripts/promote-raw-note.mjs` only for future imported raw notes. The regular development path should not need raw-note migration instructions.

## Research Extensions

Later research-facing improvements:

- explicit source provenance fields for paper, artifact, docs, and checked date if cluster/group views need stronger evidence display;
- archived cluster-analysis and working-group ideas can be reactivated from `docs/archive/cluster-analysis-working-groups.md` after website integration stabilizes;
- controlled vocabulary for `integration_roles`;
- tag pages or Axis A/B detail pages only if they support website/project navigation.

## Non-Goals

- Do not add PDF hosting.
- Do not add backend services or a database.
- Do not weaken the content schema to accommodate malformed notes.
- Do not introduce quality scores, coverage scores, ranking scores, or `trajectory_IR_relevance`.
- Do not automatically rewrite scholarly prose unless explicitly requested.
