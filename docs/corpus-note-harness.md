# Corpus Note Harness

Use this harness when converting one CIM stack paper into a public corpus note.

The 62-entry raw-note migration is complete. Use this harness only when adding a new paper or substantially revising an existing note. Use `docs/README.md` to choose context for product, UI, cluster, or website work.

## Input Contract

```text
Paper to analyze: <paper name>
Primary source: <paper URL or local path>
Official artifacts checked: <code/docs/artifact URLs>
Legacy seed note: src/content/legacy/CIM stack library compact.md
Taxonomy: src/data/taxonomy.json and src/content/legacy/CIM taxonomy.md
```

Use the legacy compact note as a starting hypothesis only. Re-check the paper and artifacts independently.

## Writing Requirements

- Separate what the paper claims from what is evidenced by equations, algorithms, experiments, code, documentation, or artifacts.
- Include technical detail that helps a researcher reuse, compare, or extend the work.
- Use a constructive, neutral, scholarly tone.
- Avoid direct negative phrasing where a scoped evidence statement is clearer.
- State artifact availability directly. If no artifact is found, write: `Artifact status: no public artifact found.`
- Use `Unknown / not found in the checked sources` for uncertain facts.
- Do not invent numbers, algorithm names, architecture parameters, benchmarks, or artifact behavior.

Preferred phrasing:

- `The demonstrated scope is ...`
- `The reusable interface is clearest at ...`
- `The paper provides strongest evidence for ...`
- `Further reuse would depend on ...`
- `The artifact exposes ... while several assumptions remain embedded in ...`

## Output Structure

```markdown
# <Paper Name> -- scoped CIM stack note

## 1. Corpus classification snapshot

| Dimension | Classification | Evidence / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Primary stack role, Axis A | A1/A2/A3/A4/A5/A6, or hybrid | 1-3 sentences |
| Middle-layer style, Axis B | B1-B7, possibly multiple | 1-3 sentences |
| First-class CIM objects, Axis C | Concrete objects | What is named or represented directly |
| Rewrite object, Axis D | Graph / loop / mapping / instruction / numeric format / runtime state / other | What transformations the work performs |
| Best corpus tags | 5-10 tags | Concrete tags |
| Closest comparison baselines | 3-6 works | Why they are close |

## 2. One-paragraph public summary

Write one polished paragraph that states the contribution, stack slice, demonstrated workload/hardware/compiler setting, and relevance to CIM compiler/IR research.

## 3. Claimed contribution vs evidenced contribution

| Paper claim | Where the claim appears | Evidence type | What is evidenced | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claim in authors' terms | Abstract / section / figure / table | Equation / algorithm / experiment / artifact / code / documentation / paper-only | Concrete supported content | Demonstrated scope |

## 4. Stack anatomy

Input / frontend:
Middle representation:
Mapping or scheduling state:
Hardware abstraction:
Backend / simulator / codegen:
Output artifact:
Evaluation loop:

**Hidden-IR reading:**
Identify where the effective semantics live if they are distributed across configs, graph annotations, search states, cost tables, pass order, simulator assumptions, or code templates.

## 5. Taxonomy placement in detail

### 5.1 Axis A -- stack role
Explain the primary and secondary stack roles and the input/output boundary.

### 5.2 Axis B -- middle-layer style
For each selected style, state the named middle representation, decisions made there, decisions embedded elsewhere, and whether one artifact can be read, verified, and rewritten.

### 5.3 Axis C -- first-class CIM objects

| CIM object | Status in this paper | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Crossbar / array / macro hierarchy | First-class / parameter / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| Bit-slicing / bit significance | First-class / parameter / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| ADC/DAC precision or sensing | First-class / parameter / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| Analog-to-digital or domain transition | First-class / costed / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| Peripheral circuits as path nodes | First-class / costed / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| Partial-sum accumulation path | First-class / costed / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| Reconstruction / shift-add tree | First-class / hard-coded / implicit / not applicable | Source |
| Runtime state, masks, KV cache, batching, sparsity | First-class / parameter / implicit / not applicable | Source |

### 5.4 Axis D -- rewrite object
State what the compiler/tool rewrites, what transformations are legal, what equivalences are exploited, what information must be preserved, and what would require an additional abstraction.

## 6. Technical mechanism reading

Explain equations/objectives, algorithms/passes, mapping/search/scheduling, cost model, hardware abstraction, precision assumptions, workload assumptions, simulator/backend assumptions.

## 7. Artifact and reproducibility

State public artifact status, runnable boundaries, input/output examples, dependencies, licenses if found, and what can be independently checked.

## 8. Comparison points

Compare against closest corpus entries using Axis A/B role, middle representation, first-class objects, and reusable boundary.

## 9. Integration notes for this library

State suggested frontmatter values and what role this paper should play in the corpus.

## 10. Final takeaway

One concise paragraph.
```

## Frontmatter Adapter

Use section 9 to fill `src/content/papers/<slug>.md` frontmatter:

- `summary`: section 2.
- `axis_A`: section 5.1.
- `axis_B`: section 5.2.
- `axis_C_first_class_objects`: section 5.3 concrete named objects.
- `axis_D_rewrite_objects`: section 5.4 rewrite targets.
- `artifact`: section 7.
- `tags`, `baselines`, `integration_roles`, `takeaways`: sections 1, 8, 9, and 10.

## Importing Future Raw Notes

Raw-note migration is no longer part of normal development. If a future imported note contains generated metadata sections, use `scripts/promote-raw-note.mjs --dry-run` first, inspect the result, and keep the same conservative evidence rules:

- missing optional URLs stay blank/null;
- missing arrays stay `[]`;
- unknown artifact or reproducibility values stay `unknown`;
- obsolete fields such as `coverage` and `trajectory_IR_relevance` are ignored;
- generated value-trajectory project sections should not be rendered as public note sections.

Never invent artifact links, licenses, paper venues, years, or research claims. If imported metadata conflicts with prose or checked sources, keep the more conservative value and leave a short `notes` entry.
